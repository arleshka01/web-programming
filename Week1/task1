The E53<br> was developed at a time when BMW still owned Land Rover and as such shares <br>many components and designs with both the Land Rover Range Rover L322 model<br> (specifically the Hill Descent System and Off Road Engine Management system) <br>and the BMW E39 5 Series (specifically engines and electronic systems). The entire<br> in-car entertainment system (Radio Function, Navigation System, Television and<br> Telecommunications systems) are shared with other BMWs and L322.
